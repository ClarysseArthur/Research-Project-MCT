# Installation
## Anaconda
As virtual environment for this project I used anaconda. The easiest way to install all the packages is through Anaconda. Download the installer and follow the installation steps through the Anaconda website https://www.anaconda.com/. Run the application after it is successfully installed.

Once Anaconda is started, import "anaconda_env.yml" via the environments tab. If everything succeeded, "IntersectionEnv" will be in the list of environments.

## Jupyter Notebook
The best way to work with Jupyter notebook is through Visual Studio Code. Start installing Visual Studio Code by following the steps on the website https://code.visualstudio.com/. Once Visual Studio Code is successfully installed, launch the program and go to the extensions tab. Using the search bar, search for "Jupyter". Install the official extension issued by Microsoft.

After installation, you can open and run "DemoTraining.ipynb" in VS Code. Don't forget to choose the correct environment (IntersectionEnv) at the top right.
